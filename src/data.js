Using a fixed rhythmic profile, a steady eighth note pulse, you can experiment with tonality and density within a specified cycle of beats. The application can help composers create a matrix of tones that can be exported as MIDI or musical XML. From there, the material can be worked with further in a sequencing or music notation program. Cycle Plus One is meant to be a starting point for experimentation, allowing the composer to play with variation using a minimal amount of musical material.",
