# John Merigliano
### Full Stack Web Developer

These are the source files for my personal website: John Merigliano, Full Stack Web Developer. The site showcases my skills as a web developer and programmer.

The live site is here: [http://lautomator.github.io/](http://lautomator.github.io/).

## Setup
The site uses [Knockout JS](http://knockoutjs.com/documentation/introduction.html)--an MVC framework--[Bootstrap](http://getbootstrap.com/), and [JQuery](https://jquery.com/). CSS styles and compile with [SASS](http://sass-lang.com/) and some automated tasks are performed by [Grunt](http://gruntjs.com/).

**You will need to download and install Grunt.** See the Grunt website for details. After installing Grunt, run `sudo npm install` to install the dependencies as per `package.json`. You may also need to install [Node](https://nodejs.org/en/) and [NPM](https://www.npmjs.com/).

To install and view the site locally, clone this repository. Run the Python HTTP Server: `python -m SimpleHTTPServer 9000`. Open your web browser to: `http://localhost:9000`. If you do not have Python installed, you can simple open `index.html` from your web browser.

## Editing
**CSS**: edit the style sheets in the `sass` directory only. Run `grunt` to watch for changes in the SASS files as they are compiled to the static `css` directory.

## Apps
These are the applications or websites showcased on this site:
* Codebreaker Game
* Frogger Game
* Neighborhood Map
* Collections
* My Wiki
* Losang Samten Website
* Mia Johnson Website
* Cycle Plus One (music sequencer: ALPHA)
